This class is a managed type instance wrapper for itk::Image. 
</summary>
            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

This class is a managed type instance wrapper for itk::Image.

            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

            <remarks>
ImageIOBase is a class that reads and/or writes image data
of a particular format (such as PNG or raw binary). The
ImageIOBase encapsulates both the reading and writing of data. The
ImageIOBase is used by the ImageFileReader class (to read data)
and the ImageFileWriter (to write data) into a single file. The
ImageSeriesReader and ImageSeriesWriter classes are used to read
and write data (in conjunction with ImageIOBase) when the data is
represented by a series of files. Normally the user does not directly
manipulate this class other than to instantiate it, set the FileName,
and assign it to a ImageFileReader/ImageFileWriter or
ImageSeriesReader/ImageSeriesWriter.

Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

This class is a managed type instance wrapper for itk::Image. 
</summary>
            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

This class is a managed type instance wrapper for itk::Image. 
</summary>
            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

This class serves as a base class for transforms that can be expressed
as a linear transformation plus a constant offset (e.g., affine, similarity

using a center of rotation and a translation instead of an offset.

This class is a managed type instance wrapper for itk::Image. 
</summary>
            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

This class is a managed type instance wrapper for itk::Image. 
</summary>
            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"

of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

This class is a managed type instance wrapper for itk::Image. 
</summary>
            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

This class is a managed type instance wrapper for itk::Image. 
</summary>
            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

This class is a managed type instance wrapper for itk::Image. 
</summary>
            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

This class is a managed type instance wrapper for itk::Image. 
</summary>
            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

This class is a managed type instance wrapper for itk::Image. 
</summary>
            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

By default, observers are created for all events. Calling this

RemoveAllObservers(), may cause the managed events to be

This class is a managed type instance wrapper for itk::Image. 
</summary>
            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

This abstract class define the generic interface for a geometrical
transformation from one space to another. The class provides methods
for mapping points, vectors and covariant vectors from the input space
to the output space.

does not provide the methods for back transfromation. Back transform
methods are implemented in derived classes where appropriate.

Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

This class is a managed replacement for itk::SegmentationLevelSetImageFilter.
</summary>
            <remarks>
This object defines the framework for a class of segmentation filters which
use level set methods.  These filters work by constructing a "feature image"
onto which the evolving level set locks as it moves.  In the feature image,
values that are close to zero are associated with object boundaries.  An
original (or preprocessed) image is given to the filter as the feature image
and a seed for the level set is given as the input of the filter.  The seed is
converted into a level set embedding which propagates according to the features
calculated from the original image.

            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

</summary>
            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

Update() checks modified times against last execution times, and

ss that the whole pipeline may execute in order to bring this filter

If no requested region has been set on the output, then the requested
region will be set to the largest possible region. Once the requested
region is set, Update() will make sure the specified requested region 
is up-to-date. To have a filter always to produce its largest possible
region, users should call UpdateLargestPossibleRegion() instead.

<summary>
This abstract class is a managed replacement for itk::ProcessObject.
</summary><remarks>
ProcessObject is an abstract object that specifies behavior and
interface of network process objects (sources, filters, mappers).
Source objects are creators of visualization data; filters input,
process, and output image data; and mappers transform data into
another form (like transforming coordinates or writing data to a file).

A major role of ProcessObject is to define the inputs and outputs of
a filter. More than one input and/or output may exist for a given filter.
Some classes (e.g., source objects or mapper objects) will not use inputs
(the source) or outputs (mappers). In this case, the inputs or outputs is 
just ignored.

This class is a managed type instance wrapper for itk::Image. 
</summary>
            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

By default, observers are created for all events. Calling this

observer invokes the managed events. Therefore, calling this

RemoveAllObservers(), may cause the managed events to be

By default, observers are created for all events. Calling this

This class is a managed type instance wrapper for itk::Image. 
</summary>
            <remarks>
Images are defined by a pixel type (modeling the dependent variables),
and a dimension (number of independent variables). 
An image is modeled as an array, defined by a start index and a size.
The underlying array can be accessed via the Buffer property.

There are three sets of meta-data describing an image. These are "Region"
objects that define a portion of an image via a starting index for the image
array and a size. The ivar LargestPossibleRegion defines the size and
starting index of the image dataset. The entire image dataset, however,
need not be resident in memory. The region of the image that is resident in
memory is defined by the "BufferedRegion". The Buffer is a contiguous block
of memory.  The third set of meta-data defines a region of interest, called
the "RequestedRegion". The RequestedRegion is used by the pipeline
execution model to define what a filter is requested to produce.

            <remarks>
A DataObject is an object that represents and provides access to data.
ProcessObjects (i.e., filters) operate on input data objects,
producing new data objects as output. ProcessObject and DataObject
are connected together into data flow pipelines.

            <summary>Separate this data object from the pipeline.</summary>
            <remarks>
This method disconnects a data object from the upstream pipeline.
Hence an Update() from downstream will not propagate back past this data object.
To completely isolate this data object from the pipeline, the application must
remove this data object from any filters which it is connected as the input.

The difference between versors and quaternions is that quaternions
can represent rotations and scale changes while versors are limited
to rotations. ie. versors are unit or normalized quaternions, the 
tensor is always 1.0. The class does not provide many operations,
it is only a basic wrapper for the actual XYZW data.

By default, observers are created for all events. Calling this
method adds a single native observer for any event. This
observer invokes the managed events. Therefore, calling this
method more than once, or calling it without first calling
RemoveAllObservers() may cause the managed events to be
invoked more than once.

By default, observers are created for all events. Calling this

the firing of managed events. Call AddAnyEventObserver() to
reset the default observers which enable the managed events.

This class is a managed replacement for itk::Object.
</summary><remarks>
Object is the second-highest level base class for most itk objects. 
It extends the base object functionality of LightObject by          
implementing callbacks (via object/observer), debug flags/methods,  
and modification time tracking. Most ITK classes should be a subclass
of Object due to the need to keep track of modified time.

 \brief Basic quad-edge topological method.

 This method describes all possible topological operations on an edge.

 It is its own inverse. It works in two ways:

   1. If this-&gt;GetOrg() != b-&gt;GetOrg(), it slice a face in two.
   2. If this-&gt;GetOrg() == b-&gt;GetOrg(), it unifies two faces.

 \warning This class only handles of the connectivity and is not aware
    of the geometry that lies at the \ref GeometricalQuadEdge level.
    It is strongly discouraged to use this method. Instead you should
    use \ref itkQE::Mesh::Splice it's geometry aware version.

 * The class constructor sets the progress to 0, and the destructor
 * sets it to 1.  In between, there should be one call to
 * CompletedPixel() per pixel.  The reporter will automatically update
 * the filter's progress at an interval resulting in the specified
 * number of updates.  The default number of updates is 100.

 * \endcode
 *
 * When used in a non-threaded filter, the threadId argument should be 0.

\class ImageIOBase
 * \brief Abstract superclass defines image IO interface.
 *
 * ImageIOBase is a class that reads and/or writes image data
 * of a particular format (such as PNG or raw binary). The
 * ImageIOBase encapsulates both the reading and writing of data. The
 * ImageIOBase is used by the ImageFileReader class (to read data)
 * and the ImageFileWriter (to write data) into a single file. The
 * ImageSeriesReader and ImageSeriesWriter classes are used to read
 * and write data (in conjunction with ImageIOBase) when the data is
 * represented by a series of files. Normally the user does not directly
 * manipulate this class other than to instantiate it, set the FileName,
 * and assign it to a ImageFileReader/ImageFileWriter or
 * ImageSeriesReader/ImageSeriesWriter.
 *
 * A Pluggable factory pattern is used this allows different kinds of readers
 * to be registered (even at run time) without having to modify the
 * code in this class.

\class LightProcessObject
 * \brief LightProcessObject is the base class for all process objects (source,
          filters, mappers) in the Insight data processing pipeline.
 *
 * LightProcessObject is an abstract object that specifies behavior and
 * interface of visualization network process objects (sources, filters,
 * mappers). Source objects are creators of visualization data; filters
 * input, process, and output visualization data; and mappers transform data
 * into another form (like rendering primitives or write data to a file).
 *
 * A major role of LightProcessObject is to define the inputs and outputs
 * of a filter. More than one input and/or output may exist for a given
 * filter. Some classes (e.g., source objects or mapper objects) will
 * not use inputs (the source) or outputs (mappers). In this case, the
 * inputs or outputs is just ignored.
 *
 * LightProcessObject invokes the following events: 
 * , Command::StartEvent, Command::EndEvent
 * These are convenience events you can use for any purpose
 * (e.g., debugging info, highlighting/notifying user interface, etc.) 
 * See Command and LightObject for information on using AddObserver.
 *
 * Another event Command::ProgressEvent can be observed. Some filters invoke
 * this event periodically during their execution (with the progress,
 * parameter, the fraction of work done). The use is similar to that of
 * StartEvent and EndEvent. Filters may also check their
 * AbortGenerateData flag to determine whether to prematurally end their
 * execution.
 *
 * An important feature of subclasses of LightProcessObject is that it is
 * possible to control the memory-management model (i.e., retain output
 * versus delete output data). If enabled the ReleaseDataFlag enables the
 * deletion of the output data once the downstream process object finishes
 * processing the data (please see text).
 *
 * Subclasses of LightProcessObject may override 4 of the methods of this class
 * to control how a given filter may interact with the pipeline (dataflow).
 * These methods are: GenerateOutputInformation(),
 * EnlargeOutputRequestedRegion(), GenerateInputRequestedRegion(), and
 * GenerateOutputRequestedRegion(). By overriding these methods, a filter
 * can deviate from the base assumptions of the pipeline execution model.

   * from being an output of its current source.  When the data object
   * is disconnected, the ProcessObject needs to construct a replacement
   * output data object so that the ProcessObject is in a valid state.
   * So DataObject::DisconnectPipeline eventually calls
   * ProcessObject::MakeOutput. Note that MakeOutput always returns a
   * itkSmartPointer to a DataObject. ImageSource and MeshSource override
   * this method to create the correct type of image and mesh respectively.

 * 
 * FastMutexLock allows the locking of variables which are accessed

 * SimpleFastMutexLock which is not a subclass of Object.
 * The API is identical to that of MutexLock, and the behavior is
 * identical as well, except on Windows 9x/NT platforms. The only difference
 * on these platforms is that MutexLock is more flexible, in that
 * it works across processes as well as across threads, but also costs
 * more, in that it evokes a 600-cycle x86 ring transition. The 
 * FastMutexLock provides a higher-performance equivalent (on 
 * Windows) but won't work across processes. Since it is unclear how,
 * in itk, an object at the itk level can be shared across processes
 * in the first place, one should use FastMutexLock unless one has
 * a very good reason to use MutexLock. If higher-performance equivalents
 * for non-Windows platforms (Irix, SunOS, etc) are discovered, they

\class Region
 * \brief A region represents some portion or piece of data.
 *
 * Region is an abstract class that represents some portion or
 * piece of a DataObject. A region is used by the pipeline when
 * processing just a portion of the data, either because 1) memory
 * limits dictate that the pipeline cannot fit the entire dataset
 * into memory; 2) the user has requested that only a piece of the
 * dataset is to be processed; or 3) parallel (multi-threaded)
 * processing of the data is required.
 *
 * There are two types of regions in itk: a structured region that
 * specifies a rectangular piece of an image (ImageRegion), and a
 * unstructured region that specifies piece i of N total pieces
 * (MeshRegion). Depending on the filter (its input and output
 * types, and its position in the pipeline), ImageRegion or MeshRegion
 * will be used to describe the region.
 *
 * Region is a light-weight object and not reference counted. This 
 * means that is behaves differently than ITK classes that are
 * reference counted. For example, smart pointer access is not
 * provided, and the (subclasses') constructor, destructor, 
 * copy constructor and operator= are all public.

Friends of DataObject 

Friends of Multithreader.
   * ProcessObject is a friend so that it can call PrintSelf() on its
   * Multithreader. 

\class ProcessObject
 * \brief ProcessObject is the base class for all process objects (source,
 *        filters, mappers) in the Insight data processing pipeline.
 *
 * ProcessObject is an abstract object that specifies behavior and
 * interface of network process objects (sources, filters,
 * mappers). Source objects are creators of visualization data;
 * filters input, process, and output image data; and mappers
 * transform data into another form (like transforming coordinates or
 * writing data to a file).
 *
 * A major role of ProcessObject is to define the inputs and outputs
 * of a filter. More than one input and/or output may exist for a given
 * filter. Some classes (e.g., source objects or mapper objects) will
 * not use inputs (the source) or outputs (mappers). In this case, the
 * inputs or outputs is just ignored.
 *
 * ProcessObject invokes the following events: 
 * Command::StartEvent, Command::EndEvent
 * These are convenience events you can use for any purpose
 * (e.g., debugging info, highlighting/notifying user interface, etc.) 
 * See Command and LightObject for information on using AddObserver.
 *
 * Another event Command::ProgressEvent can be observed. Some filters invoke
 * this event periodically during their execution (with the progress,
 * parameter, the fraction of work done). The use is similar to that of
 * StartEvent and EndEvent. Filters may also check their
 * AbortGenerateData flag to determine whether to prematurally end their
 * execution.
 *
 * An important feature of subclasses of ProcessObject is that it is
 * possible to control the memory-management model (i.e., retain
 * output versus delete output data). The ReleaseDataFlag enables the
 * deletion of the output data once the downstream process object
 * finishes processing the data (please see text). The
 * ReleaseDataBeforeUpdateFlag enables the deletion of the
 * ProcessObject's output data from a previous update if that output
 * data is slated to be regenerated by the pipeline process.  Setting
 * this flag can control peak memory usage during a subsequent
 * pipeline update.  For a ProcessObject, the ReleaseDataFlag defaults
 * to false and the ReleaseDataBeforeUpdateFlag defaults to true.
 * Some subclasses of ProcessObject, for example ImageSource, use a
 * default setting of false for the ReleaseDataBeforeUpdateFlag.
 *
 * Subclasses of ProcessObject may override 4 of the methods of this class
 * to control how a given filter may interact with the pipeline (dataflow).
 * These methods are: GenerateOutputInformation(),
 * EnlargeOutputRequestedRegion(), GenerateInputRequestedRegion(), and
 * GenerateOutputRequestedRegion(). By overriding these methods, a filter
 * can deviate from the base assumptions of the pipeline execution model.

 * \brief Abstraction of the Events used to communicating among filters

 *
 * EventObject provides a standard coding for sending and receiving messages
 * indicating things like the initiation of processes, end of processes,
 * modification of filters.
 *
 * EventObjects form a hierarchy similar to the itk::ExceptionObject allowing
 * to factorize common events in a tree-like structure. Higher detail can
 * be assigned by users by subclassing existing itk::EventObjects.
 *
 * EventObjects are used by itk::Command and itk::Object for implementing the
 * Observer/Subject design pattern. Observers register their interest in 
 * particular kinds of events produced by a specific itk::Object. This 
 * mechanism decouples classes among them.
 *
 * As opposed to itk::Exception, itk::EventObject does not represent error 
 * states, but simply flow of information allowing to trigger actions 
 * as a consequence of changes occurring in state on some itk::Objects.
 *
 * itk::EventObject carries information in its own type, it relies on the 
 * appropiate use of the RTTI (Run Time Type Information).
 *
 * A set of standard EventObjects is defined near the end of itkEventObject.h.

 * derived from this class. Note that this class is derived from
 * std::exception, so an application can catch ITK exceptions as
 * std::exception if desired.
 *
 * ExceptionObject maintains two types of information: a location
 * and description (both of which are strings). The location is the
 * point in the code where the exception was thrown; the description
 * is an error message that describes the exception. The ExceptionObject
 * can be thrown explicitly in code, or more conveniently, the 
 * itkExceptionMacro (found in Common/itkMacro.h) can be used.

        <member name="T:itk.OStringStream">
itk::OStringStream wrapper to hide differences between
std::ostringstream and the old ostrstream.  Necessary for
portability.

        <member name="M:itk.OutputWindowDisplayText(System.SByte!System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsSignUnspecifiedByte!System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsConst*)">
The following is used to output debug, warning, and error messages.
Use a global function which actually calls:
OutputWindow::GetInstance()-&gt;DisplayText();
This is to avoid Object #include of OutputWindow
while OutputWindow #includes Object.
